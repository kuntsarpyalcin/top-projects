  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>My family loves homemade fries and the bag fries from the store just weren't enough and became too expensive. So I tried better â€” after all, it makes chicken, shrimp, and onion rings crispy so why not potatoes! Now even my wife can't get enough of these French fries. They even stay crispy when you reheat them in the microwave.</p>
